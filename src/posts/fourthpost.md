<p>**Strong** __Gunsite Glock Service Pistol__</p>

<p>The Gunsite Glock Service Pistol is built on the Glock 45 format, which is billed as a “crossover” design. In short, this means the gun
pairs a full-size frame like that found on the Glock 17 with a compact slide similar in dimension to that on a Glock 19. This allows for a
full, generous grip frame and means the gun accepts flush-fit magazines with a 17-round capacity. The slide measures just under 7” long and
houses a 4.02” barrel, the same barrel length found in the G19. Ultimately, this means the Gunsite Service Pistol will fit in all holsters
sized for the Glock 19.</p>

Longhorn is the only cattle breed truly adapted to America. Hardy and aggressive, the Texas Longhorns were well suited to the rigors of
Life of the Southwestern United States. They survived as a primitive animal on the most primitive of ranges and became the foundation
stock of that region’s great cattle industry.</p>

<p>**Strong** __Bond Arms BULLPUP9 (LTD Production)__</p>

<p>There are several other 9mm sub-compact pistols out there, and with the exception of the Bond Bullpup, they have one common problem — their barrels are, arguably, too short. Because of that, the excellent 9mm Luger round does not have time to attain what I’d consider its optimum velocity. In some of those guns, there’s barely 2" of rifling</p>
<p>A few years ago, Arne Boberg solved the problem. He extended the barrel to the rear, over the magazine well, and used a back-feeding magazine system. For a few years, he produced the pistol as the Boberg XR9-S. A little over a year ago, the design was acquired by Bond Arms, and I’ve been trying out one of the first examples of the Bond “Bullpup.”</p>
<p>The original Boberg pistol had some very unique features and they’re carried on in this model. The cartridges are put into the magazine nose-first, exposing the case-head and rim at the rear. When the slide cycles, a set of “tongs” pulls the round out of the magazine to the rear, onto a platform in the frame. The moving slide engages a lug on the platform face lifting the round to the breech-face and extractor, perfectly aligned to go into the chamber. None of this is tricky or flimsy — all of these parts are substantial, and made of high-grade steel.</p>
<p>Another feeding advantage is the turn-barrel locking system. In addition to the straight-line feed, the turn-barrel design also gets the bore axis closer to the hand. And, the turning rate tends to adjust to the power of the load.</p>
