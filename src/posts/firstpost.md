<p>Learning how to clean the outside of a gun is like learning how to do a lot of routine maintenance. It often starts with asking questions. This process helps us think through a problem or a task before we begin.</p>
<p>And of course, if were not asking the right questions, were not going to arrive at the right solutions.</p>
<p>So what are some questions one might ask when learning how to clean the outside of a gun?</p>
<p>Two of the most important questions would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of gun are we cleaning?</li>
<li>How does our knowledge of gun safety inform the gun cleaning process? (Sneak peek: Among other safety protocols, it means making sure the gun is unloaded when cleaning it.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cleaning A Gun</h2>
<p>Keeping a gun clean on the outside is just as important as keeping it clean on the inside. Over a period of time, your firearm will collect residue, especially if it sees a lot of use. Ask Rightful Liberety Arms about cleaning kits, cleaning patches, and cleaning solvents if youre unfamiliar with this process.</p>
<p>Like each and every tool in our garage, guns require regular inspections and maintenance to keep them operating at peak performance. That means regular cleaning and lubrication, especially if the gun has seen a lot of use.</p>
<p>Cleaning the inside of a gun helps keep it in good shape and will extend its lifespan. But a lot of grime can also accumulate on the outside of a gun over time: moisture, dirt, oil, grease each ofts performance.</p>
<p>Responsible and experienced shooters, writes <a href="https://magtechammunition.com/safety/">Magtech Ammunition</a>, will pay close attention to the proper maintenance of their weapons. The importance of good gun care is critical to safe and smooth operation of the firearm. Cleaning, lubricating, and rust prevention will ensure years of top performance.</p>
<h2>Simple, Safe Steps</h2>
<p>The good news about learning how to clean the outside of a gun is that you dont need any special polishes or soaps to get the job done. Some gun owners swear by WD-40 and a clean rag. Others use more traditional methods, such as Rem Oil, Inox or Lanox to clean the outside of guns.</p>
<p>Just be sure not to load it with too much of these cleaning agents. You dont want to leave your gun with a greasy or slippery residue.</p>
<p>Make sure you wipe it down well enough so that just the gun’s finish shines through and there are no fingerprints visible.</p>
<p>Its important to keep a gun lightly oiled, so avoid dry patches. But be on the lookout for excess gun oil or surface rust, too. These can all affect your guns performance.</p>
<p>As for the cloth itself or a rag to wipe off the gun a gun cloth is the perfect tool for this job. Most are treated with silicone lubricants to help get that finish to a beautiful shine. CLP (for Clean, Lubricate, Protect) Wipes are a good choice.</p>
<p>No matter what material you use to clean the gun, be sure to stick to your safe gun-cleaning habits. Clean your unloaded firearm in a work area that is well-lit and well-ventilated. Make sure the table or platform on which you are cleaning your gun is stable.</p>
<p>Learning how to clean the outside of a gun is important. Its much less extensive and intensive than cleaning the inside of a gun. Keep an eye out for additional blogs on gun cleaning, especially about cleaning the inside of the gun.</p>
<p>Theres a lot more to cover when it comes to the insides: cotton patches, cleaning rods, bore snakes, bore brushes, cleaning the barrel, learning how to strip a gun (field strip), and more.</p>
